## 👋 Hey, I'm Anthony

Senior Developer at Lancaster University.
I build production systems, AI-powered tools, and...well, all sorts.

2026 is going to be my year of shipping and exploring new tech and ideas. I am aiming to build in public, stream, and create content around development, my workflow and projects as well as AI in general

Currently building:
- 🎲 **GMprentice** — AI sandbox for practising GMing without a table - currently in beta https://gmprentice.app
- ✨ **SPARK** - System Planning & Architecture with Reasoning/Knowledge - Solutions Architect as a Service
- 💷 **Buy It Once** - BuyOnce helps you understand the true value of what you own. Cost-per-year insights, lifespan tracking, and calm replacement decisions.
- 🎥 **Dev Influencer Companion** - App to help keep track of content, links and code snippets for developer influencers and content creators
- See more at https://lexio.app
- 🛠️ Innovation at Lancaster University (mobile, cloud, AI)

I care about:
- Shipping and iteration over perfection
- Thoughtful AI use (agents, guardrails, cost-aware infra)
- Developer experience and long-lived systems

## 🧪 How I Work

- Build in public (when I can)
- Prototype fast, refactor often
- Prefer boring tech with sharp edges
- Treat AI as a collaborator, not a crutch
